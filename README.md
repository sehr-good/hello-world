# hello-world

Hi! Sergey here, I am just trying out a sample GitHub tutorial. I like programming in Unity, and later want to upload my project on GitHub. I am still struggling with the GitHub interface.
Now I am trying out creating branches. And I have created a commit, let's see what happens when I create another. And now let's try merging a branch to master instead of rebasing.
Hey, one more change.

This is for the second branch.
